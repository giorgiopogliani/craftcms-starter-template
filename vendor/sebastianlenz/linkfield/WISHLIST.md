# Link field wishlist

This document contains a list of requested features for the link
field plugin. We want to keep the issue list clean but also write
down these wishes. Anyone who likes to contribute to this plugin
may pick features of this list.

## Ability to choose the entry type in a structure

Or, more general, the ability to configure the criteria for
the element select modal. This is trivial from the API perspective,
but the required setting ui is very complicated.


## Feature Request: Add ability to define reusable field settings
https://github.com/sebastian-lenz/craft-linkfield/issues/47
