This is a twig extension for automatically create components as tags. The name of the tag is based on files in a directory. This is highly inspired from blade components.  

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require performing/twig-components
```

## Upgrade from 0.0.6 to 0.1.0

### Syntax
You would need to change the syntax into the following:
```twig
{% x:component-name with {any: 'param'} %}
    <strong>Any Content</strong>
{% endx %}
```

Now you can also reach for components files that are in subfolders with a dot-notation syntax. For example, a component at `/components/button/primary.twig` would become
```twig
{% x:button.primary with {any: 'param'} %}
    <strong>Any Content</strong>
{% endx %}
```
### Installation

Now you don't need to specify the absolute component directory but just your components folder relative to the twig templates directory.

## Usage

### Installation
You can create the twig extension that will find all the files in the given directory and create the component tag.
```php
$extension = new \Performing\TwigComponents\ComponentExtension('/relative/twig/components/directory');
```

For example, Craft CMS users can do the following:
```php
Craft::$app->view->registerTwigExtension(
    new \Performing\TwigComponents\ComponentExtension('/components')
);
```

### Components
Next you can create a file in the components directory like this.
```twig
{# /components/button.twig #}
<button {{ attributes.merge({ class:'text-white rounded-md px-4 py-2' })|raw }}>
  {{ slot }}
</button>
```

Use the new created tag.
```twig
{# /index.twig #}
{% x:button with {class:'bg-blue-600'} %}
  <span class="text-lg">Click here!</span>
{% endx %}
```

The output generated will be like this.
```html
<button class="bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md px-4 py-2">
  <span class="text-lg">Click here!</span>
</button>
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
